              I'm Amey, a 15 year old student currently residing in Bengaluru,
              India. I love cars, programming, and cookies. As a result, this
              website is dedicated to all three of them.
              <br /> <br /> I've been programming for over four years now, yet
              I'm still grasping the mind-boggling possibilites it unravels. So,
              I have included other little projects I've completed through this
              ongoing exploration of computer science. In the future, I hope to
              develop innovative and impactful tech-projects which can make a
              difference in people's lives. If you'd like to contribute,{' '}

              and enthusiasm towards automotives. Maybe one day, this dream will
              be satiated.
